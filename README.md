## Logbook

- Started test on Jan 14 at 7:40PM
- Created repository at 7:45PM
- Started reading challenge docs at 7:48PM
- Finished reading challenge docs and mempool.space docs (https://mempool.space/docs/api/rest)
  - Goals: Tried to find paging and other resources but couldn't find it... 
- Started thinking about project constraints, recommendations, technical requirements and project delivery planning at 8:00PM
  - Given the expected time box of 3 to 5 hours, I will create a pretty straightforward project on SwiftUI (as it is a positive thing) with a simple list, without pagination since there's no API capability for it and pull-to-refresh feature. 
  - The first thing is to organize the data I will use from the API as well as the UI design,
  - I will try to focus on the architecture (View) I am used to deal on my daily activities so it will be written on MVVM.
  - Unit tests are important so I will develop things that's not related to the UI with tests just to avoid having a third-party dependencies to deal with snapshot tests
- Finished initial plan at 8:08PM
- Paused progress at 8:08PM
