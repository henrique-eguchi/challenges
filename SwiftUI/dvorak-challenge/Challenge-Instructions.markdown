# Summary

For this project you will be coding two screens of the app leveraging SwiftUI and Combine and connecting the two together.

See the attached video for the look and feel of the finished app. It is important that you can tap from the Home screen to the Event details screen as shown in the video, scroll the services carousel, and that the Event screen shows different content based on which event is selected. Note that the video includes additional modules with slightly different content than the PDF, these are not necessary to create.

"Assets.pdf" shows the screens themselves as they're intended to be built. You'll also find an "Images" directory which has the images shown on these pages in their sizes.

## Requirements

- Should be built in any Xcode >= 15.0
- For the UI, you must use 100% SwiftUI. Create a new Xcode project using SwiftUI as the starting point.
- Emphasize reusability on the frontend and proper separation of Views. I will be looking into your code reuse on the frontend.
- Use the MVVM design pattern and separate View code from Model and ViewModel logic
- Please create local mocked models that match what's in the PDF and screenshots. It's important that the data looks identical to what is in the PDF. No need for JSON or any API callbacks.
- Both the home screen and the event details screens should function along with the scrolling behavior, see the video as a reference.
- The designs should match the PDF as much as possible.
- The app should be responsive and adjust in size accordingly when ran on smaller/larger devices than the example in the PDF
- Use git commits throughout the process so I can see the progression towards the finished version.
- No unit testing is required
