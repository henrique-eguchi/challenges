FYI

- Unfortunately I could not extract the fonts and some specific font colors using 'Digital Color Meter' from the .pdf / .mp4;
- Some provided icons is cut so I replaced by system icons for now;
- Some mock images was provided in low res - It would be better changing them to a high res later;
- DVORA logo is a png but has a white background color, it would be better having a transparent background so we can use it in other places with different background colors;
- Missing some images from .pdf like the stars from the Promotions component;
- Link between EventsView and EventDetailsView built with NavigationLink - it might change if we follow a Coordinator structure for instance;
